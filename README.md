### Features?
- Full stroke engine functionality
- Looks kinda cool
- Emergenct Stop/Pull-out buttons
- Might currently look a bit ugly but should also run on iPad/Vision Pro
### How do I install it?
**sry, you need a mac for this one :(**
- clone the repo
- open it in Xcode
- change your team (just trying to build should throw an error that helps you find this)
- install it on a connected iPhone

I'll also try to provide IPAs so you can just sideload those - might even do an AppStore release but only with official permission
### Future stuff planned?
- if theres something you'd like to see in here, feel free to create an issue and I'll see what i can do

### Cool stuff, do you like money?
